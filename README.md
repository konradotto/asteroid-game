# asteroid-game

Repository for refactoring the asteroid game code from assignment 6 in DIT184 Software Analysis and Design.

For this assignment we were given the badly designed code for an asteroids game. The goal of the assignment was to improve the design of the code applying separation of concerns and creating a modular layout.

The code is currently only partly improved. For example a hardware layer dealing with the in-game sounds has been added.
